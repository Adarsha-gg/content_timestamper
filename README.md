*** A Blog Timestamper ***

It takes a string and then incodes it with a timestamp in the blockchain setting the caller to its owner. This makes the content un-retimestamped ever in the future which can be used for copyright purposes.

**Issues**
Doesnt currently work with strings such as "()", " ' ", "_"
I have to learn Regex which I haven't yet T_T

**What I want this project to do**
Make this deployable on a cheap blockchain.
Lets users claim words/phrases that they like.
Assosciate the wallet address with a social media so you can see who owns what.
Deploy it in a website for users to interact.
Auto update the UI whenever a new word is claimed. (Can trigger a event ig)
Add payment to wallet address.
Develop frontend for doing all the stuff mentioned above
